# Obsidian Paragraph Toggle Plugin

This incredibly simple plugin simply adds extra paragraph spacing in Reading Mode. This is useful for when you're using a snippet to imitate indented paragraphs for writing, where traditionally you would only put one line break after a paragraph because they're indicated with indentation. In Obsidian's edit mode this can be styled to look correct by adding an indent to each line, but in html all the lines get turned into solid <p> blocks, which makes it impossible to style individual paragraphs.
